I've been very interested in the implementation of [Subjective-C Unread Menu](https://github.com/subjc/SubjectiveCUnreadMenu). So I rewrote it in Swift to learn its implementation and also practise iOS programming. The original version is written in Objective-C by [Sam Page](https://github.com/sampage).

Subjective-C Unread Menu
======================

A rebuilding of [Unread](http://jaredsinclair.com/unread/)'s pull-for-menu interaction.

Built for the [Unread's pull-for-menu](http://subjc.com/unread-overlay-menu/) post on [Subjective-C](http://subjc.com).
